REQUIREMENTS
------------

SUPPORTED IMAGES
------------------

The Windows GD+ library is used for image manipulation. This currently
supports:

  PNG
  BMP
  JPEG
  GIF
  TIFF

Alpha channels are supported and will be included in the images sent to the
switcher.

Images will need to be the same resolution as the switcher. Running in
debug mode you can see the detected resolution on the switcher.

NOTES
-----

This has been tested with a Blackmagic Design ATEM Production Studio 4K. I do
not have access to any other switchers to test with, but if they use version
6.2 of the SDK, then they should work.
